## Contribute to FMDB

All kinds of contributions are welcome, including but not limited to the following:

- fix typo or bugs
- add documentation or translate the documentation into other languages
- add new features and components

### Workflow

If you plan to add some new features that involve large changes, it is encouraged to open an issue for discussion first.

**Issues**

1. click the New issue button on the [Issues page](https://github.com/ashut0shk/fmdb/issues)
2. choose one template to create an issue

**Pull Request**

1. fork and pull the latest [FMDB repository](https://github.com/ashut0shk/fmdb.git)
2. checkout a new branch (do not use the master or main branch for PRs)
3. commit your changes
4. create a PR

Please describe your issue or PR as clear as possible. And use `NULL.` to fill blocks you don't know what to say instead of deleting them.
